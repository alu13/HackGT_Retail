# HackGT_Retail

This is our HackGT6 (October 2019) project. 
Our goal was to provide a chat service where a user could search for a particular piece of clothing and find compiled results from all nearby retail stores.
Our project follows these steps:

1. Beautiful Soup to scrape local retail stores in our area (Macys, Bloomingdales, etc.)
2. We connected our scraper to Google DialogFlow to enable chat with a user.
3. We compiled & returned all results similar to the user's search (ex. White Shirt)
